# eWay-CRM API
API used for communication with [eWay-CRM](http://www.eway-crm.com/) web service. See our [documentation](https://kb.eway-crm.com/documentation/6-add-ins/6-7-api-1) for more information. 

## Establishing connection
To communicate eWay-CRM web service, we first have to establish connection. This must be done prior to every action we we want to accomplish with use of the web service. To do that, we have to lad the ```eway.class.php``` and create new instance of ```eWayConnector()``` with three parameters: service address, username and password. 

```php

//Load API
require_once "eway.class.php";

// Create connector
$connector = new eWayConnector('https://trial.eway-crm.com/31994/WcfService/Service.svc/', 'api', 'ApiTrial@eWay-CRM');

```

## Actions at the service
You can check actions available on your service on ```[service adress]/WcfService/Service.svc/help``` .  We have put together a list of examples for some basic actions you can use the service for, so don't be shy an try it out.

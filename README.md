# eWay-CRM API
API used for communication with [eWay-CRM](http://www.eway-crm.com/) web service.

## Establishing connection
To communicate eWay-CRM web service, we first have to establish connection. This must be done prior to every action we want to accomplish with use of the web service. To do that, we have to load the ```eway.class.php``` and create new instance of ```eWayConnector()``` with three parameters: service url address (same as the one you use in outlook), username and password. 

```php

// Load API
require_once "eway.class.php";

// Create connector
$connector = new eWayConnector('https://trial.eway-crm.com/31994', 'api', 'ApiTrial@eWay-CRM');

```

## Actions at the service
You can check actions available on your service on ```[service adress]/WcfService/Service.svc/help```. If the help is not enabled on your API have a look at [instructions](https://kb.eway-crm.com/faq-1/tips/how-to-activate-eway-crm-api-help) to activate it. We have put together a list of examples for some basic actions you can use the service for, so don't be shy an try it out.

### Item conflicts
How does it work exactly? Every item in eWay-CRM database has it's own revision number (like in SVN/Git) called ItemVersion. This number is increased by one everytime the item is updated. Using this number, eWay-CRM in Outlook is able to determine a conflict and show you the conflict resolving dialog (Use mine or theirs). When working with API, we don't force you to work with ItemVersion when you don't need it. When you save a record, you should send ItemVersion higher than the currently stored one (higher by one). By this you say that you have seen the revision N and the data you are sending is the revision N+1. Everything you send is saved. If you send ItemVersion lower or equal to the current or you don't send the ItemVersion at all, the system thinks that you have not seen the latest revision N. In Outlook, you would get conflict dialog. In API, to make things simplier, an automatic merge is done. The merge is simple. Every field value you are sending is saved except nulls. So your data are preserved but none of your deletings is performed.

Every Save method has also a boolean flag, which turns the auto-merge off and you get a conflict error code instead.

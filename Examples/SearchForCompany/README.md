# Searching for Company

This example should show you how to search for company based on one or more parameters.

All you need to is to make yourself an array with parameters by which you want to search company and use it as an argument of function ```$connector->SearchCompanies()``` .

```php

//Search criteria
$company = array(
                'FileAs' => 'CompanyK'    
                );

// Create connector
$connector = new eWayConnector('https://trial.eway-crm.com/31994/WcfService/Service.svc', 'api', 'ApiTrial@eWay-CRM');

//Search for the company
$output = $connector->SearchCompanies($company);

```

## Output

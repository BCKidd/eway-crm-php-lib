Deletion is done by using function ```$connector->DeleteCompany()``` with GUID of company we want to delete.

```php

//GUID of company
$company = '7dfde804-2ed4-11e9-be3d-bc5ff40119b6';

//Delete the company
$output = $connector->DeleteCompany($company);

```

We can now check that if we look for the company now, eWay-CRM will not find any results. The company was successfully deleted.
